**If build fails:**
- Check that ALL files uploaded to GitHub
- Verify `package.json` exists in the root
- Make sure `src/App.jsx` exists

**If you see the old app:**
- Clear browser cache: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (or `Cmd + Shift + R`)
- Try incognito/private window
- Check you're visiting the NEW Vercel URL (not old one)

**If build is instant (under 30 seconds):**
